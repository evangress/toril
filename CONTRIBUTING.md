# Contributing to Toril

Thanks for your interest in Toril — a MarkText-style WYSIWYG markdown editor built on
**Tauri + TypeScript + Milkdown**. This guide covers how to set up, what the
non-negotiable rules are, and how to get a change merged.

> **Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) first.** It is the authoritative design document:
> the decided stack (§2), the data-safety rules (§3), the backend↔frontend command
> contract (§5), the milestone plan (§8), and the project conventions (§10). This file
> is the human-friendly front door; `CLAUDE.md` is the source of truth when the two
> seem to disagree.

## Scope

Toril is, for now, a focused **markdown** editor. The roadmap runs through Phase 4 (§8):
MarkText parity, then polish and a Windows release. Multi-format editing (JSON/XML/YAML/…)
is a deliberately **deferred** future idea (§12), not current work — please don't open PRs
that build it into the current milestones.

If you're unsure whether something is in scope, open a
[Discussion](https://github.com/kovirlabs/toril/discussions) or an issue before writing code.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** stable (via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/)) — the crates use **edition 2024**.
- **Node.js** LTS and **pnpm** (enable it with `corepack enable pnpm`).
- Platform webview toolchain for running/building the app:
  - **Windows:** Microsoft C++ Build Tools (MSVC) + the WebView2 runtime (preinstalled on Win11).
  - **Linux:** `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` + `pkg-config` (plus `libappindicator3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `patchelf` for bundling).
  - **macOS:** Xcode command-line tools.

### Build-environment note (important)

The Rust **app** crate links against the system webview. On a machine *without* those deps,
you can still do most contribution work — the frontend (`pnpm build` / `test` / `typecheck`)
and the logic crates (`fsatomic`, `vaultscan`) build and test fine. Only `pnpm tauri dev`,
`pnpm tauri build`, and a full `cargo build` need the webview toolchain. **GUI flows
(dialogs, tabs, sidebar, watcher reloads) must be verified in a real window** on a
webview-capable machine before claiming they work.

---

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install            # first time
pnpm tauri dev          # run the app (opens the window)

pnpm test               # vitest — round-trip + tabs + security (jsdom)
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit (TS strict)
pnpm build              # tsc + vite build (frontend only)

cd src-tauri && cargo test -p fsatomic -p vaultscan   # logic crates (no webview needed)
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy        # clean before every commit
```

Project layout is documented in `CLAUDE.md` §4 (frontend at the repo root in `src/`,
Rust backend in `src-tauri/`).

## The non-negotiable rules

These come from `CLAUDE.md` §3 (Data Safety) and §10. A change that violates any of them
will not be merged, no matter how nice the feature is. This is a notes app — the user's
writing is the only thing that truly matters.

1. **Atomic saves.** Never write a file in place. Writes go through the `fsatomic` crate
   (temp file + fsync + atomic rename). A crash mid-save must never corrupt a note.
2. **One canonical markdown representation.** All markdown ⇄ document conversion goes through
   **`src/editor/serializer.ts`** and nowhere else. Never introduce a second conversion path
   or keep two diverging buffers.
3. **Treat opened/pasted content as untrusted.** Anything rendered in the webview must pass
   through `src/sanitize.ts`. A `.md` file can carry hostile HTML.
4. **All disk I/O lives in Rust.** The frontend never touches the filesystem directly — it
   calls a Tauri command via `src/ipc.ts`. New backend calls go in the command contract (§5).
5. **Keep `.md` files plain and portable.** When two designs compete, prefer the one that
   stays Obsidian-vault compatible (no proprietary container, no sidecar lock-in).

If a feature would compromise data safety, the feature loses.

## Dependencies

- **Pin everything.** `Cargo.lock` is committed; `package.json` uses exact versions. Upgrade
  deliberately, never on a whim.
- **Only healthy packages** (§2/§10). Never add a dependency that is deprecated, unmaintained,
  or low-reputation — check the npm/crates.io `deprecated` flag, recent publish history, and
  publisher reputation before adding. If a feature's *only* viable dependency is unhealthy,
  **defer the feature** (note it in §8) rather than shipping the bad dep.
- **Don't touch `src-tauri/third-party/glib/`.** It's gtk-rs `glib` vendored verbatim except a
  single security patch, wired in via `[patch.crates-io]` (see `CLAUDE.md` §2 and the
  `Cargo.toml` comment). It is excluded from the workspace on purpose — don't fmt/lint/edit it.

---

## Code style

- **Rust:** edition 2024; `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy` must be clean before you commit.
- **TypeScript:** `strict` mode on; **no `any`**.
- Write code that reads like its surroundings — match the existing naming and idiom.

---

## Tests and gates

Every change must keep the suite green. Add tests for new behavior; the round-trip and
atomic-save gates are mandatory and predate features by design (§8, §11).

- **Round-trip gate** — `pnpm test` (`tests/roundtrip.test.ts`): source ⇄ WYSIWYG must not
  lose or mangle content (CommonMark + GFM + emoji today).
- **Atomic-save gate** — `cargo test -p fsatomic`: interrupting a save leaves the original intact.
- **Data-safety / sanitize** — `tests/security.test.ts`.
- Plus `vaultscan` and `tabs` tests.

Run `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `cargo test -p fsatomic -p vaultscan` before opening a PR.
If a change affects GUI flows, verify it in a live window and say so in the PR.

## Commits and pull requests

- **One logical change per branch.** Branch off `main`.
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):** `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
  `chore:`, `ci:`, etc. Scope is optional (e.g. `feat(editor): …`).
- **Open a PR against `main`.** Describe what changed and why; note any GUI verification done
  and call out anything left unverified.
- **Keep `CLAUDE.md` in sync.** If you change the command contract (§5), the milestones (§8),
  or any data-safety behavior (§3), update the relevant section in the same PR.
- CI builds the app on push of a `v*` tag and publishes a release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

---

## Reporting bugs and ideas

- **Bugs:** open an [issue](https://github.com/kovirlabs/toril/issues). Include your OS, what you
  did, what you expected, and what happened. For anything involving losing or mangling note
  content, say so prominently — data-safety bugs are top priority.
- **Questions and proposals:** start a [Discussion](https://github.com/kovirlabs/toril/discussions).
